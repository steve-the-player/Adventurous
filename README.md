Modpack for modrinth

Adventurous! is a modpack I'm working on creating involving all the standard optimization mods, some QOL changes I've personally enjoyed, and then lots of tweaks to world generation. 

There are over 200 mods in this modpack, so it takes a moment to start up as everything verifies. 
A few things behave in ways that are not what I want for this modpack, but will need further investigation. 

I think I've gotten all of the crashes fixed, but please link a report using mclo.gs in the issues section if anything does come up! 

Due to permissions from some of the included mods, this modpack will only be available for download from Modrinth
